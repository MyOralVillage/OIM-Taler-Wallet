| Title | Description | Acceptance Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **[Error Prevention/Proper Alerting]** | As a **[illiterate or innumerate user**], I want **[clear audio/visual alerts]** for things such as a low balance, or attempting to send more than what's in my account, so that I can **[avoid overdrafts or mistakes]**. | - [Errors are displayed with distinct icons] <br> - [Audio alerts explain the issue in simple terms.] <br> - [The errors should not scare users away or be complex] |
| **[Payment Confirmation]** | As a **[innumerate user]**, I want the app **[to guide me and confirm a payment with clear pictographs/audio]**, so that I can **[avoid mistakes and be confident when using the app]**. | - [Payment flow with confirmation is simple and easily broken down] <br> - [Upon confirmation, there should be positive validation for the end user] <br> - [If there is a mistake noticed, it should be easy and obvious on how to change it and fix it.] |
