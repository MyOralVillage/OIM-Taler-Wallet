#### Q12. How does your project fit within the overall product from the partner?

-   Look at the big picture of the product and think about how your project fits into this product.
    
-   Is your project the first step towards building this product? Is it the first prototype? Are you developing the frontend of a product whose backend is developed by the partner? Are you building the release pipelines for a product that is developed by the partner? Are you building a core feature set and take full ownership of these features?
    
-   You should also provide details of who else is contributing to what parts of the product, if you have this information. This is more important if the project that you will be working on has strong coupling with parts that will be contributed to by members other than your team (e.g., from a partner).
    
-   You can be creative for these questions and even use a graphical or pictorial representation to demonstrate the fit.
    
-   Briefly specify what your partner considers a success for this project. Do they want you to build specific features? Publish a usable product? Just a prototype? Be as specific as you can be at this point.
    

Our project fits into the partner’s overall product as the Android version of the Orali Money app, designed to make money management accessible to users with different literacy and numeracy levels, including those who are illiterate or innumerate. While this is not the first prototype since an iOS version already exists, our work focuses on building an MVP for Android that expands the app’s reach and makes it more accessible to its target users.

The MVP will include core features such as sending and requesting money, making payments in stores, and maintaining a clear record of balances and past transactions. A major emphasis of our work is on the Oral Information Management (OIM) interface, which aims to improve usability and make the app intuitive for users who may struggle with traditional text or number-heavy interfaces.

On the technical side, we will collaborate closely with Iván Ávalos (Android developer, Taler Systems) for guidance, while consulting Brett Matthews (Founder, MyOraliVillage), David Myhre (Director of Partnerships), and Marc Stibane (iOS Developer, Taler Systems) for key decisions and milestones. This ensures consistency across both iOS and Android development.

For our partner, success means delivering a usable MVP on Android, with particular attention to the OIM component. This MVP will then be tested with the company and its target users, serving as the foundation for future iterations and improvements of the product.
