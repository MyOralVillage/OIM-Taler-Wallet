### Q13: What are some potential risks to your project?

- **Designing for low-literacy, low-numeracy users**  
  Creating an interface that is truly intuitive and understandable for illiterate/innumerate adults is a challenge. Even small design missteps (icons, flows, or colors) could confuse users:contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}.

- **Scope creep and misaligned expectations**  
  Partners have flagged certain features as out-of-scope (e.g., onboarding, warnings, bank withdrawals). There is a risk of the team unintentionally expanding scope beyond what’s feasible:contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}.

- **Collaboration across iOS/Android teams**  
  Coordination with Ivan (Android dev) and Marc (iOS dev) may face challenges in asset/code sharing, version control, and ensuring design consistency:contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}.

- **Limited experience with this unique user group**  
  Most of the team does not have direct experience designing for illiterate users, which may result in gaps between assumptions and actual user needs.

- **Technical complexity of visual language**  
  Icons, animations, and graphic capacities (e.g., place value, tabular formats) are critical for OIM but may be difficult to implement smoothly on mobile devices.
