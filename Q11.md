We are a part of the android development team. We are rebuilding the existing iOS app into a native Android version that maintains the core interface while also integrating the Oral Information Management (OIM) interface. We’ll be working closely with Iván Ávalos, the Android developer at Taler Systems who is also contributing to the Orali Money app. At the same time, we’ll be reporting key milestones and design decisions to Brett Matthews (Founder, MyOralVillage), David Myhre (Director of Partnerships, MyOralVillage), and Marc Stibane (iOS Developer, Taler Systems).

We believe this role is a strong fit for us because it is very front-end and user-experience focused, and our team has solid experience in both areas. For example, Amish worked on the Centre for Dreams app with UofT Blueprint, designing accessible user journeys for people with developmental disabilities. Fares brings front-end and UI/UX internship experience, along with industry knowledge of working with external stakeholders. Other team members also have internship and project experience in development and design, including areas such as backend and full stack development, giving us a strong and well-rounded foundation. Together, we are well-positioned to create solutions that prioritize accessibility, clarity, and usability for the app’s target users.
