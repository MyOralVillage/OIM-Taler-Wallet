### Q3:Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem/need?
For the world's one billion illiterate and innumerate adults, managing money has many challenges. They rely on informal methods like memorization, or trusting literate family members or agents, which exposes them to fraud, theft, and a lack of financial privacy and control. Existing mobile banking apps are not an option as they are text-based and require numerical literacy, effectively excluding this vast population. 
Orali Money addresses this gap by offering a visually intuitive and easily learnable mobile wallet designed specifically for those with little to no formal schooling.
The reasons why people would want our product is firstly,
It provides a form of intuitive financial independence. With an intuitive, graphic-based interface, users can send, receive, and verify money on their own, and keep it private as well, which many people would want to do. But they are unable to currently, due to their lack of understanding.
Secondly, users can now understand their finances and track history reliably, which before, they would basically have to rely on memory, as they can't read or write.
This project aligns with our partners core missions as well as My Oral Village is creating financial tools and projects that illiterate adults can use safely and independently. Taler focuses on building secure, private, and open-source payment systems. We are building a very similar app to one already made in iOS by Taler/MOV, so it aligns with our partner's mission very well.
