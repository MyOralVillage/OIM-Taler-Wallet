# Orali Wallet for Android / fooBaz

## Product Details

### Q1: What is the product?

There are approximately one billion people globally who are innumerate or illiterate, and they have historically been excluded from advancements in personal financial management. To bridge this gap, our partners have re-engineered the user interface and user experience of the existing Taler wallet. This decentralized and anonymous microtransaction wallet now uses pictographs and animations specifically designed to be accessible to people who are innumerate and illiterate. Our partners' current prototype is only available on iOS, but with the help of Taler's lead Android developer, we will be implementing the wallet for Android devices.

Our partners are:

1.  **My Oral Village**
    -   Brett (Founder, Community Testing)
    -   David (Director of Partnerships)
2.  **Taler Systems**
    -   Marc (iOS developer; project lead)
    -   Iván (Android developer)
