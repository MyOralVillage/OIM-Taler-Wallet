# Team 9 - FooBaz

 > _Note:_ This document is meant to be written during (or shortly after) your review meeting, which should happen fairly close to the due date.      
 >      
 > _Suggestion:_ Have your review meeting a day or two before the due date. This way you will have some time to go over (and edit) this document, and all team members should have a chance to make their contribution.


## Iteration XX - Review & Retrospect

 * When: FILL IN THE DATE WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD YOUR REVIEW MEETING
 * Where: PHYSICAL LOCATION AND/OR ONLINE

## Process - Reflection


#### Q1. What worked well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that worked well.


### 1. Constantly Updated Lucid UML Diagrams  
Maintaining and regularly updating our **Lucid UML diagrams** worked extremely well. It kept everyone aligned on the system architecture, helped us plan integrations, and made it easier to visualize dependencies between classes. This practice reduced confusion when connecting different modules and made integration smoother.

### 2. Clear Ownership and Tiered User Story Management  
Each team member was responsible for **one user story**, while a few team leads managed **two user stories each under the project manager**. This tiered structure encouraged accountability and strong coordination. It also made it easier for the project manager to monitor progress and identify bottlenecks early.

### 3. Bug Tracking via Dedicated Discord Channel  
Having a **dedicated Discord channel** for bugs proved highly effective. Team members reported bugs as soon as they were found, explained how they were fixed, and discussed potential causes. This real-time tracking prevented repeated issues and acted as a lightweight bug log without redundant documentation.

### 4. Multi-Platform Communication (WhatsApp + Discord)  
Using both **WhatsApp and Discord** worked well for different purposes. WhatsApp for quick updates and scheduling, and Discord for technical collaboration. This dual setup made communication efficient and context-appropriate.


#### Q2. What did not work well

List **process-related** (i.e. team organization and how you work) decisions and actions that did not work well.

### 1. Inconsistent Use of GitHub Issues  
We used **GitHub Issues** for task tracking, but inconsistently. Since priorities and features often shifted, issues weren’t always updated or closed properly. This made it hard to gauge actual progress and occasionally caused confusion about who was responsible for what.

### 2. Fragmented Gradle Dependencies and Asset Management  
Initially, each developer used separate **Gradle dependencies** and stored assets individually, with plans to merge later. This caused **integration problems, version mismatches, and duplicated files**. Unifying dependencies and asset structure earlier would have prevented these issues.

### 3. Delayed Integration Testing  
Integration testing was **postponed until multiple modules were completed**, leading to complex debugging later. Conducting smaller, more frequent tests throughout development would have caught issues earlier and reduced last-minute fixes.

### 4. Informal Task Tracking Outside Version Control  
Some smaller tasks were tracked only through **chat messages** rather than GitHub or shared documentation. While convenient, this caused occasional overlap or missed responsibilities. A structured workflow where all updates are logged in version control would have improved coordination.


#### Q3(a). Planned changes

List any **process-related** (i.e. team organization and/or how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

 * Ordered from most to least important, with supporting argument explaining a change.

#### Q3(b). Integration & Next steps
Briefly explain how you integrated the previously developed individuals components as one product (i.e. How did you split the work across your team) and how was the work integrated together.

 * Keep this very short (1-3 lines).


## Product - Review

#### Q4. How was your product demo?
 * How did you prepare your demo?
 * What did you manage to demo to your partner?
 * Did your partner accept the features? And were there change requests?
 * What were your learnings through this process? This can be either from a process and/or product perspective.
 * *This section will be marked very leniently so keep it brief and just make sure the points are addressed*
