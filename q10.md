#### Q10: What are the rules regarding how your team works?
Our partners communicate mainly through outlook, and our project
leader serves as the main point of contact.
Our team is expected to communicate and read our internal discord
at least once a day. We are held responsible through issue tracking, 
weekly standups, and progress reports with the TA. If a team member is
not responsive, we will first try our best to get in contact with 
that team member. In the mean time, their work is delegated to 
other team members by the project manager. If they continue to be 
unresponsive and do not contribute, we will then escalate to the TA 
to take appropriate next steps.
