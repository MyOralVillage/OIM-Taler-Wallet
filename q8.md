### Q8: How will you work as a team?

As a team, we have two 2-hour meetings per week, on Sundays and Thursdays. 
We meet on either Discord or Google Meets. For each meeting, we assign a 
scribe to take notes and a lead to run the meeting. We plan the agenda for 
the next meeting at the end of each one, ensuring every meeting has 
specific issues and tasks to address. These are all tracked in our 
meeting minutes. We also have a weekly 2-hour meeting with our partners 
every Tuesday. Our meetings on Sundays will outline the sprint for the week,
and our meeting on Thursdays will track our progress. Our partner meeting on
Tuesdays will be to confirm our goals for the week and get any critical
information / guidance we may not have in house.

Since our team and our partners are spread across four time zones 
and three continents, we were only able to schedule one meeting 
before our first deliverable. Our initial meeting on September 23, 
2025, covered introductions and an agreement on the project’s 
Minimum Viable Product (MVP), which we defined through user 
stories. We also discussed our tech stack, how we will integrate 
with the existing project, and identified potential risks and 
mitigation strategies.
