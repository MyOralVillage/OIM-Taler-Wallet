### Q5: Have you decided on how you will build it? Share what you know now or tell us the options you are considering.

We have decided to build **Orali Money for Android** using **Kotlin** with **Jetpack Compose** as our main UI toolkit. After considering alternatives (e.g., Scala, which was too enterprise-oriented with limited APIs), Kotlin with Compose provides the best support for modern Android development.

**Technology stack (current plan):**
- **Frontend:** Kotlin + Jetpack Compose (modern declarative UI framework for Android).
- **Backend:** **Out of scope for our team**. Backend services and the payment engine are handled by **Taler Systems**. We will focus only on the UI and frontend logic:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.
- **Architecture:** MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel) pattern for clean separation of concerns.
- **Build System:** **Gradle** (Android Gradle Plugin) will manage project dependencies, build variants, and CI/CD integration. Gradle allows modular builds, dependency resolution, and seamless APK generation for different environments.
- **APIs / Integrations:**
  - Device-native authentication (PIN, fingerprint, Face ID) rather than custom authentication:contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.
  - Integration with **GNU Taler** ([taler.net](https://www.taler.net/en/index.html)), a privacy-preserving payment system, for transaction processing and balance verification.
  - Graphics and icons from MyOralVillage’s OIM project, adapted for Android.
- **Deployment:** The app will be packaged as an APK and tested on both emulators and physical devices. Partner collaboration may also extend to publishing on the Google Play Store once features are production-ready.
- **Version Control / Collaboration:** GitHub will serve as the central repository, shared with Ivan (partner Android developer) for asset and code synchronization:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.
