| **Receiving Money** | As an **adult user with low literacy and numeracy skills**, I want **clear and simple notifications when I receive money**, so that I can **immediately know and confirm the transaction without confusion**. | - After money is received, the user receives an audio and visual alert with appropriate icons. <br>
| **Checking Past Transactions** | As an **adult user with limited literacy skills**, I want to **check past money transactions using icons or voice**, so that I can **keep track of my financial activity without needing to read written records**. | - When I open the transaction history and select a past transaction, I should be able to tap an audio icon to hear a spoken summary of the transaction.
