#### Issues and Github Projects
Our team will be using Github projects as the main team management platform. 
Each release / feature is organized into specific projects, and each project is 
composed of multiple concrete milestones. These milestones have issues assigned 
to them which we have agreed upon in our meeting, and dates which they are due by. Finally, 
we have meeting minutes to fall back on if we need to reference anything. 
If we have a major task, our project manager brings it up in the 
weekly sprint planning meeting (or a team member suggests it). 
We then discuss what sub tasks we need to delegate and which team 
members will be best suited for that role. 
We then assign issues and add it to the appropriate milestone. 
Issues are prioritized by issue dependency, and how critical an issue is to the overall
project being implemented. Issues are organized in our Github project 
by either being in the "TODO" (not started/non-priority), "WIP" (work 
in progress; currently completing), "review/testing" (waiting 
approval or tests), or "done" (issue has been completed 
successfully). When all issues are in the "done" category, that means 
our feature has been thoroughly tested and released, and we are ready 
to move on to the next project. We have a workflow in github which 
automatically reminds assignees of open issues each day and when
they are due. Another workflow sends biweekly reminders for 
milestones (which change to daily when the milestone is <= 2 days 
away or overdue).

#### Communication
We will be using Mumble and Discord for unofficial / casual conversations, 
email for official conversations, and BBB for video calls and presentations.
