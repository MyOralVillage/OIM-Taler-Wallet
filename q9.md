### Q9: How will you organize your team?

#### Issues and Github Projects
Our team will be using Github projects as the main team management platform. Each release / feature is organized into specific projects, and each project is composed of multiple concrete milestones. These milestones have issues assigned to them which we have agreed upon in our meeting, and dates which they are due by. Finally, 
we have meeting minutes to fall back on if we need to reference anything. If we have a major task, our project manager brings it up in the weekly sprint planning meeting (or a team member suggests it). We then discuss what sub tasks we need to delegate and which team members will be best suited for that role. We then assign issues and add it to the appropriate milestone. Issues are prioritized by issue dependency, and how critical an issue is to the overall
project being implemented. Issues are organized in our Github project by either being in the "TODO" (not started/non-priority), "WIP" (work in progress; currently completing), "review/testing" (waiting approval or tests), or "done" (issue has been completed successfully). When all issues are in the "done" category, that means our feature has been thoroughly tested and released, and we are ready to move on to the next project. 

#### Communication
We will be using Mumble and Discord for unofficial / casual conversations, email for official conversations, and BBB for video calls and presentations.
