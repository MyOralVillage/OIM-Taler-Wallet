### Q14: What are some potential mitigation strategies for the risks you identified?

- **For user interface challenges:**  
  Prioritize **user testing** early with sample icons and flows. Focus on **iterative design** with feedback from partners in Sierra Leone who already work with target users.

- **For scope creep:**  
  Clearly document and re-confirm with partners which features are **in-scope vs. out-of-scope**. Track any new feature ideas for later phases rather than committing immediately:contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}.

- **For collaboration issues:**  
  Use a **shared GitHub repo** and maintain consistent documentation. Weekly sync meetings with Ivan and Marc will help align Android and iOS versions:contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.

- **For gaps in understanding user needs:**  
  Leverage **partner expertise** (Brett and David from MyOralVillage) to validate design assumptions. Conduct walkthroughs of the OIM demo to guide UI design:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.

- **For technical complexity of graphics:**  
  Start with a **simplified icon/animation set** from the Salone OIM Library and gradually expand. Use Jetpack Compose’s graphics/animation APIs, which are well-suited for custom UI elements.
