### Q2: Who are your target users?
Our primary users are illiterate and/or innumerate adults who lack formal schooling. The goal is to provide an easily and safely usable mobile wallet that makes sending money, validating transfers, and viewing transaction history intuitive and accessible. The wallet will aim to build their "financial numeracy", the ability to independently understand financial records in order to empower them with the ability to manage their money.
